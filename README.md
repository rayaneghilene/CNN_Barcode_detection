# Barcode Recognition using CNN
This repository contains code for training and using a barcode recognition model based on a custom neural network architecture.



## Project Structure
- model.py: Defines the custom model architecture for barcode recognition.
- dataset.py: Provides functionality for loading and preprocessing the barcode dataset.
- train.py: Script for training the barcode recognition model.
- test.py: Script for testing the trained model on new barcode images.
- utils.py: Contains utility functions for data processing and evaluation.
- requirements.txt: Lists the required Python packages to run the project.
## Getting Started
To get started with the project, Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/barcode-recognition.git

## Model Architecture
The barcode recognition model is based on a custom neural network architecture. The model consists of several convolutional layers followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation. Max pooling is applied after each convolutional layer to downsample the feature maps. The final output layer produces the predicted barcode number.
